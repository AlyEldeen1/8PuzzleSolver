# 8PuzzleSolver
This project implements an 8-puzzle solver using various search algorithms, including Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Iterative Deepening DFS, and the A* algorithm. The 8-puzzle consists of a 3x3 grid with numbered tiles, where the goal is to arrange the tiles in a specific order by sliding them into an empty space.
