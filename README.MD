# 8-Puzzle Solver

## Overview

The 8-Puzzle Solver is a Python project that implements various search algorithms to solve the classic 8-puzzle problem. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of different algorithms, including Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Iterative Deepening DFS, and A* Search, using both Manhattan and Euclidean heuristics.

## Features

- Solves the 8-puzzle problem using multiple search strategies.
- Implements Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Iterative Deepening DFS, and A* algorithms.
- Compares the performance of each algorithm based on the number of nodes expanded.
- Provides detailed traceability of each step in the puzzle solution.
- Visualizes the solution process (bonus feature).
